-----------

**1.** Clone this git repository.

**2.** Set up AWS cli on your local machine. Use the following guides to accomplish that:
	[Install the AWS Command Line Interface on Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-linux.html)
	[Install the AWS Command Line Interface on Microsoft Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-windows.html)
	[Install the AWS Command Line Interface on macOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-install-macos.html)

**3.** Install Node Package Manager (NPM) and install on your machine: https://nodejs.org/en/

**4.** Create a Cloudinary account: https://cloudinary.com/

		Keep track of your Cloudinary Cloud Name, Cloudinary API Key, and Cloudinary API Secret.

		When you create a discord webhook it will give you something like this: https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/464491015357595669/uT9-nZZi1R13kCM6a_oc-D3gF32raBoAP1A67r2KsgDvKMxXz2I4kqGHx31DLRsNd4d0
		All you need to copy down for this tutorial is "464491015357595669/uT9-nZZi1R13kCM6a_oc-D3gF32raBoAP1A67r2KsgDvKMxXz2I4kqGHx31DLRsNd4d0"
		You will use this string in step 12 and is the discord_key value.
		
	
**6.** In Cloudinary, you will need to click on "Media Library" then create a new folder called "CR".


**7.** Download the card repository from the Royale API github: https://github.com/RoyaleAPI/cr-api-assets/archive/master.zip (you only need the "cards" folder)


**8.** Upload the contents of the "cards" folder to your CR folder in Cloudinary.

**9.**  On Line 8 of "warlog.js" enter in your own cloudinary key after it says "cloud_name:"



**10.** On line 76 of "warlog.js" correct the time zone to your time zone according to Moment Timezone documentation (http://momentjs.com/timezone)


		The default time zone will be Norwegian Locale. If you are central time you need to change it. Example: .tz('America/Chicago')

		
**11.** On line 2 of "example-event.json" edit the clan_id field with your own clan ID


**12.** On line 3 of "example-event.json" edit the existing discord_key to match the string created in the "Generate discord webhook" step.


**13.** Install ClaudiaJS: https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/installing.html


	You should only really need to run "npm install claudia -g" to have it working.


**14.** You need to have a RoyaleAPI key handy. If you do not have a RoyaleAPI key, please get one by joining the RoyaleAPI Discord: http://discord.me/RoyaleAPI


	Go to the developer-key section and then enter "?crapikey get" in the chat. A bot should message you with your API key. Do not share this with anyone!



The handler will be warlog.handler. A handler is The module-name.export value in your function. For example, "warlog.handler" would call exports.handler in warlog.js.


You only need to run 2 commands to start using the bot. You will need to be in the warlog directory on your machine when executing these commands.
